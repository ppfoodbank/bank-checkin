# Pike Place Food Bank checkin application

Open-source progressive web app that allows volunteers to quickly check in customers at the Pike Place food bank, and submit anonymous demographic data to a backend.

Produced during the Microsoft OneWeek hackathon in 2018. We welcome contributions from the community to improve the application, and any nonprofit is welcome to take it and use it as part of their own check-in process.
